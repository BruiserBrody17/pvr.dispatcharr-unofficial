*(The project's running punch-list -- not part of the "confirmed live" API_NOTES.md family of docs. New items go under **Open**, in whichever category fits; when one is resolved, move it to [CLOSED_ITEMS.md](CLOSED_ITEMS.md) with a short note of how it was confirmed, rather than deleting it -- the closed entries are the record of what was tried and why. This file holds only what is still open, so it stays readable in one sitting; the history is there. A citation of this file for an item that is resolved (`docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md` in a code comment or an older doc) means that item's entry in `CLOSED_ITEMS.md`. The 1.0-era release-checklist history this file used to keep was removed once `1.0` stopped being a near-term target (see `CLAUDE.md`'s versioning note); it's preserved in git history.)*

# Open items

## Status at a glance

**2 open, 347 closed** (the closed entries are in [CLOSED_ITEMS.md](CLOSED_ITEMS.md)). Both came from the two
2026-10-10 source reviews: the Tvheadend addon ([PVR_HTS_COMPARISON.md](PVR_HTS_COMPARISON.md)) and Dispatcharr itself
with its plugin catalogue ([DISPATCHARR_SOURCE_REVIEW.md](DISPATCHARR_SOURCE_REVIEW.md)). Nothing is left from the
2026-10-19 live check of four audit fixes on `Piers` (two findings held here too: the manifest throttle, fixed the same
day, and the TSan start-up crash, fixed on 2026-10-22) or from the 2026-10-18 read-only audit, made on `Piers` and
checked against `Omega`'s code the same day (all 21 held here; 14 fixed on 2026-10-19, four on 2026-10-21, one on
2026-10-22 and the last two closed without a change on 2026-10-22, all in `CLOSED_ITEMS.md`).

### Known gaps, deliberately deferred

#### Wake-on-LAN for a Dispatcharr host that sleeps

**Opened 2026-10-10, from the pvr.hts comparison; deferred.** pvr.hts sends a Wake-on-LAN packet to a configured MAC
address (`kodi::network::WakeOnLan`, part of Kodi's addon API) before its first connect, for a backend that sleeps when
idle. Cheap to add as an optional setting, but Dispatcharr is usually a container on an always-on host and nobody has
asked. Pick it up if a user reports a sleeping server; the whole change is the setting, one call before the first
request, and a note in the README.

#### Multiple Dispatcharr servers from one Kodi

**Opened 2026-10-10, from the pvr.hts comparison; deferred.** Kodi 20 and later let one PVR addon run several backend
instances (`instance-settings.xml` next to `settings.xml`); pvr.hts added it in 20.4.0 with a one-time migration of the
pre-instance settings in its `addon.cpp`. This addon is one instance, and `docs/API_NOTES.md`'s "Single-instance
assumption: partially hardened, not fully" section lists what else assumes that (the API-key persistence, the recurring
rule tag). Worth doing only if someone runs two Dispatcharr servers, or wants two accounts (admin for the companion
plugins, non-admin otherwise) against one server from one Kodi; the migration step and the per-instance settings
handling in `OnAddonSettingChanged()` are the work. Not started.

### Tooling (tools/)

None open.
